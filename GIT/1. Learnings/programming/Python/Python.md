I want to learn Python . Please create a comprehensive study plan following the 80-20 rule, focusing on the core 20% of concepts that will allow me to start building projects. The plan should be structured week by week for 5 weeks, with each week covering specific topics.

After each week core learning period, please suggest one project of increasing difficulty (from beginner to advanced) that will help me apply and expand my knowledge of 5. For each project, provide a brief description and list the key concepts it will help reinforce.

Please ensure the plan is detailed enough for a beginner to follow, but also challenges me to think and problem-solve independently.
