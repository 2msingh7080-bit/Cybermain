# Burp Suite Proxy and Spider Configuration
### **1. Starting Burp Suite and Proxy Setup**

- **Proxy Functionality**:
    - Intercepts and proxies communication.
    - Spiders websites to gather details about the web server.
- **Steps to Enable Proxy**:
    - Open Burp Suite → Verify the **proxy listener** is running on the local host interface.
    - Check the **Intercept all requests/responses** option to capture traffic.
    - Configure the **web browser** proxy settings to match Burp Suite.

---

### **2. Verifying Proxy Configuration**

- Perform a test by requesting a webpage.
- If properly configured:
    - Burp intercepts the request.
    - Optionally, disable **Intercept** to allow smooth traffic flow while still recording communications.

---

### **3. Setting Scope of Tests**

- Purpose: Restrict testing to a specific target application.
- **Steps**:
    1. Copy the **target application URL** from the browser.
    2. In Burp Suite:
        - Go to **Target** → **Scope** → Paste the URL.
    3. Filter **Sitemap results** to show only “In Scope” items.

---

### **4. Spidering the Target Web Application**

#### **4.1 Enabling the Spider**

- **Right-click** on the target in the Sitemap and select **Spider This Host**.
- Alternatively:
    - Open the **Spider** tab.
    - Click **Spider (paused)** to enable it.

#### **4.2 Configuring Spider Options**

- **Spider Behavior**:
    
    - Check for `robots.txt` to gather additional links.
    - Explore root directories and set **maximum link depth** for results.
- **Passive Spidering**:
    
    - Allows continued crawling as you navigate the site manually.
- **Form Submission Settings**:
    
    - Options:
        - Do not submit forms.
        - Display forms for manual inspection.
        - Automatically fill forms (e.g., email, username, etc.).
- **Login Form Handling**:
    
    - Similar settings as forms but tailored for login forms.
- **Threading and Failure Settings**:
    
    - Increase thread count for faster crawling.
    - Configure behavior for network failures.
- **Request Headers**:
    
    - Customize headers, User-Agents, or cookies for spider requests.

---

### **5. Running the Spider**

1. Enable the spider.
2. Trigger the crawl by requesting a webpage from the browser.
3. Burp will:
    - Detect forms (e.g., login forms).
    - Prompt for manual input of username/password.
    - Optionally, **ignore forms** if not needed.

---

### **6. Inspecting Results**

- **Target Tab**: View the collected resources.
    
    - **Tree View** (Left Panel):
        - Folders and paths organized hierarchically.
    - **Requests Table** (Right Panel):
        - **Host Address**: Web server address.
        - **Method**: HTTP request method (GET, POST).
        - **URL**: Resource path.
        - **Params**: Indicates parameters (e.g., query strings).
        - **Status Code**: HTTP response (200 = success).
- **Detailed Inspection**:
    
    - Raw Request: View parameters, headers, and hex view.
    - Response:
        - **HTML View**: Inspect the page content.
        - **Render View**: Visualize the webpage.
- **Focused Analysis**:
    
    - Select specific paths (e.g., `/admin` folder) in the Tree View to filter related requests.

## **Summary of Key Takeaways**

1. Burp Suite proxies and spiders web traffic to map web server resources.
2. Configure **proxy** and **scope** to target a specific application.
3. Use the **Spider** tool to automate resource discovery:
    - Customize spider behavior, threading, and form handling.
4. Inspect results in the **Target** tab:
    - Organized Tree View and detailed request-response analysis.
5. Burp Suite provides tools to render, analyze, and filter discovered resources.
