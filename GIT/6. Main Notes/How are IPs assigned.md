# How are IPs assigned

### How DHCP Works

1. **Client Device**: The device (e.g., laptop, computer) seeks an IP configuration upon connection to the network.
2. **DHCP Server**: The server receives requests and assigns IP addresses along with other necessary network configurations.

### The DORA Process

The process of DHCP is commonly referred to as **DORA**, which stands for:

1. **Discover**:
    
    - The client broadcasts a **DHCP Discover** message to locate available DHCP servers.
    - This message is sent to the **network** to find a DHCP server.
2. **Offer**:
    
    - DHCP servers that receive the Discover message respond with a **DHCP Offer** message, which contains:
        - Proposed IP address
        - Subnet mask
        - Lease duration
        - Other network configuration details
3. **Request**:
    
    - The client receives multiple offers from various servers and selects one by sending a **DHCP Request** message to the chosen server.
    - This message informs the server of the acceptance of its offer.
4. **Acknowledge**:
    
    - The DHCP server confirms the request by sending a **DHCP Acknowledgment** message.
    - This message finalizes the IP address assignment and includes other network configuration settings.

### Importance of DHCP

- **Automation**: Eliminates the need for manual IP configuration, reducing administrative overhead.
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Allows IP addresses to be reused and assigned based on demand, enhancing efficiency and resource utilization.
- **Error Reduction**: Minimizes the chances of IP address conflicts and misconfigurations.

---

### Conclusion

- DHCP simplifies network management and enhances connectivity for devices on IP networks through its automated configuration process.
- Understanding the DORA process is crucial for grasping how devices obtain IP addresses and other configurations on a network.
### Understanding the DHCP Process

#### Overview

- The DHCP process involves a series of steps that allow a client device (such as a PC, laptop, or mobile device) to obtain an IP configuration from a DHCP server.
- This communication occurs through a four-way handshake, which includes discovery, offer, request, and acknowledgment.

---

### Visual Representation

- **Client Device**: Represents the device requesting an IP address (e.g., PC, mobile phone, tablet).
- **DHCP Server**: The server that assigns IP addresses and provides network configuration details.

#### Steps in the Process

1. **Client Request**:
    
    - The client device sends a request for an IP configuration to the DHCP server.
    - This step is depicted by an arrow from the client to the server, indicating the request for an IP address.
2. **Server Offer**:
    
    - Upon receiving the request, the DHCP server sends back a set of possible IP configurations.
    - The server asks the client if the offered configuration is acceptable for use.
3. **Client Acceptance**:
    
    - If the client finds the offered IP configuration suitable, it sends a message back to the server indicating acceptance of the IP address.
    - The client requests permission to use the offered IP configuration.
4. **Server Acknowledgment**:
    
    - Finally, the DHCP server responds with an acknowledgment, granting the client permission to use the specified IP address.
    - This step confirms that the IP address is now assigned to the client device.

---

### Four-Way Handshake Summary

- The entire process is essentially a communication loop:
    - **Discovery**: Client asks for IP configuration.
    - **Offer**: Server provides a set of configurations.
    - **Request**: Client accepts one configuration.
    - **Acknowledge**: Server confirms the assignment.

#### Memory Aid

- Remember the DORA acronym:
    - **D**iscover
    - **O**ffer
    - **R**equest
    - **A**cknowledge

### Conclusion

- The DHCP process facilitates efficient network management by automating IP address assignments.
- Understanding the client-server communication and the four steps of the DORA process is crucial for grasping how devices connect to networks.
### DHCP Process: Discovery and Offer Steps

#### Overview of DORA

- The DHCP process is encapsulated in the DORA acronym, which stands for:
    - **D**iscovery
    - **O**ffer
    - **R**equest
    - **A**cknowledge
- This section covers the **Discovery** and **Offer** steps in detail.

---

### Step 1: Discovery

1. **Client Request for IP Configuration**:
    
    - The client (or host) sends a request for a new IP configuration from the DHCP server (often referred to as DSB).
    - This is represented by an arrow in the communication diagram, illustrating the client’s request reaching the server.
2. **Broadcasting the Message**:
    
    - Since the client is new to the network, it does not have a valid IP address. To initiate communication, it uses a temporary IP address of **0.0.0.0**.
    - Additionally, the client does not know the IP address of the DHCP server, so it broadcasts its request to all devices on the network using the broadcast address **255.255.255.255**.
    - This message is essentially a request saying, “Hey, can I have an IP configuration?”
3. **Challenges Faced by the Client**:
    
    - The client does not possess its own valid IP, nor does it know the server's IP, making the request via broadcast necessary.
    - By broadcasting the request, the client hopes that the DHCP server (or any responding device) will acknowledge its request.
4. **Temporary Address Usage**:
    
    - The client operates with a temporary IP address **0.0.0.0** until it receives a valid configuration from the DHCP server.
    - This approach allows the client to communicate with the network, albeit in a limited capacity.

---

### Step 2: Offer

1. **Receiving the Discovery Message**:
    
    - All DHCP servers on the network receive the broadcast message sent by the client. If there are multiple DHCP servers, they may all respond to the request.
    - Each server, upon receiving the discovery request, prepares an offer message.
2. **Broadcasting the Offer**:
    
    - The DHCP server does not know the client's actual IP address (as it was **0.0.0.0**). Therefore, it sends the offer message as a broadcast to all devices on the network.
    - This offer message is intended for the specific client, but since it was sent to a broadcast address, all devices will receive it.
3. **Message Filtering**:
    
    - Each device on the network checks the MAC address included in the offer message:
        - If the MAC address in the offer matches its own, the device accepts the offer.
        - If it does not match, the device discards the message, as it is not intended for it.
4. **Accepting or Rejecting the Offer**:
    
    - Upon receiving the IP configuration offer, the client has two options:
        - **Option 1**: If the client does not like the offered IP configuration (e.g., due to conflicts), it can reject the offer.
        - **Option 2**: If the client finds the offer acceptable, it sends an acknowledgment back to the DHCP server indicating that it would like to use the offered IP address.

---

### Conclusion

- The Discovery and Offer steps are critical in the DHCP process, facilitating the initial communication between a new client and DHCP servers in the network.
- Understanding these steps helps in grasping how devices automatically obtain IP configurations without manual intervention.
## DHCP Process: Request and Acknowledgement Messages

### DHCP Request Message

1. **Initiation of DHCP Request**:
    
    - After a node (client) receives an IP configuration offer from a DHCP server, it must indicate whether it accepts or rejects the offered configuration.
    - The node analyzes the offered IP configuration. If it finds it acceptable, it sends a **DHCP Request message** to the server.
2. **Understanding the DHCP Request**:
    
    - The node requests the DHCP server to use the provided IP configuration.
    - This is essentially a message that states:
        - **"Hey, I like this IP. Can I use it?"**
3. **Direct Communication**:
    
    - Unlike the initial broadcast message sent when the node was searching for a DHCP server, the DHCP Request message is sent directly to the identified server's IP address (e.g., `192.0.0.1`).
    - This message is a **unicast** rather than a broadcast since the node now knows the location of the DHCP server.
4. **Possible Outcomes**:
    
    - **Acceptance**: If the node accepts the offered IP configuration, it will send the Request message, indicating its intention to use the specified IP.
    - **Rejection**: If the node finds the IP configuration conflicting or unacceptable, it will send a **Decline message** back to the DHCP server, stating:
        - **"I do not like this IP. It is conflicting or already in use."**
5. **Server Response**:
    
    - If the node sends a decline message, the DHCP server may attempt to send another configuration offer.
    - If the node accepts the offer, it sends the Request message to the DHCP server for confirmation.

### DHCP Acknowledgement Message

1. **Receiving the Request**:
    
    - Upon receiving the DHCP Request from the node, the DHCP server processes the request.
    - The server analyzes the request to determine if it can grant the requested IP address.
2. **Acknowledgment**:
    
    - If the server can fulfill the request, it sends an **Acknowledgement message (DHCP ACK)** back to the node.
    - This message indicates:
        - **"You requested an IP, and it has been granted. You can now use it."**
3. **Exceptional Cases**:
    
    - If the DHCP server is under high load or experiences a crash, it may not be able to respond to the request.
    - In such cases, the server sends a **Negative Acknowledgement (DHCP NAK)**, which states that the request cannot be processed at this time.
    - The node can resend the request later when the server is available again.
4. **Final Confirmation**:
    
    - Once the DHCP ACK is received, the node can use the assigned IP address for communication.
    - From this point forward, all messages from the node will be directed to the assigned IP address.

### Summary of Key Takeaways

- The DHCP process involves a **Request** from the node after receiving an offer from the server and an **Acknowledgement** from the server to confirm the acceptance of the requested IP.
- Direct communication occurs in the request phase, transitioning from broadcasting to unicasting.
- Rejections and negative acknowledgements highlight the need for the DHCP server to manage requests and potential conflicts.
- Successful completion of the process allows the node to utilize the assigned IP address for its network activities.
# DHCP Four-Way Handshake Process

The **DHCP four-way handshake** is a critical process for network configuration, allowing devices to obtain IP addresses and other configuration settings. Below is a detailed overview of the four messages exchanged during this process.

## 1. Discovery Message

- **Initiating Device**: Client (PC)
- **Purpose**: The client sends out a discovery message to request an IP address.
- **Source IP**: `0.0.0.0` (indicating the client has no IP address yet)
- **Destination IP**: `255.255.255.255` (broadcast address)
- **Message**:
    - Indicates the client is new to the network and requires an IP configuration.
    - Sent as a broadcast since the client does not know the DHCP server’s IP.

## 2. Offer Message

- **Initiating Device**: DHCP Server
- **Purpose**: The DHCP server responds to the discovery message with an offer of an IP address.
- **Message Components**:
    - Contains the proposed IP address for the client.
    - Additional information may include:
        - Subnet Mask
        - Default Gateway
        - DNS Servers
- **Delivery**: Sent as a broadcast since the server does not know the client's MAC address.

## 3. Request Message

- **Initiating Device**: Client (PC)
- **Purpose**: The client requests to use the offered IP address.
- **Message**:
    - Indicates acceptance of the proposed configuration.
    - If the offered IP address conflicts with another device, the client sends a negative message indicating the conflict and requests a different IP.

## 4. Acknowledgment Message

- **Initiating Device**: DHCP Server
- **Purpose**: The server acknowledges the client's request to use the IP address.
- **Message**:
    - Confirms the allocation of the IP address to the client.
    - If the request is declined or not acknowledged, a negative acknowledgment is sent instead.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **DHCP Process Steps**:
    
    1. **Discovery**: Client requests an IP address.
    2. **Offer**: Server offers an IP address and configuration details.
    3. **Request**: Client accepts the offer and requests the IP.
    4. **Acknowledgment**: Server confirms the IP allocation.
- **Importance**: Understanding the DHCP process is essential for network management and troubleshooting. Mastery of DHCP, along with DNS, is crucial for networking professionals.
    
- **Final Note**: Regular review of this process will enhance comprehension and application in practical scenarios.
