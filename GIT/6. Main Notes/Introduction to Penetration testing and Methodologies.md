# Introduction to Penetration testing and Methodologies


# 26/04/25

### Pen testing Vs Ethical Hacking

**Penetration Testing**
Narrowly Focused Approach Penetration Tester needs to have good knowledge and skills only in the specific area in which he/she is required to conduct penetration testing Penetration tester needs to be an expert in report writing Details paperwork is required including legal agreement, engagement, etc.

**Ethical Hacking**
Comprehensive Approach ethical Hacker needs to have comprehensive knowledge of Attackers Tools, techniques and Procedures (TTP's) to compromise information system. ethical Hacker is not necessarily required to be a good writer Less Paperwork is required

#### For password checking 
bitwarden 
recommendation - use sentences
recommendation  (that are given )called in company is known as security policy  
multifactor 
disable brute force 

#### **SA vs VA vs PT**

**Security Audit**
A security audit just checks whether the organization is following a set of standard security policies and procedures


**Vulnerability**
Assessment A vulnerability Assessment focuses on discovering the vulnerabilities in the information system but no confirmation on exploitability



**Penetration testing**
Penetration testing is a methodological approach of manual verification of exploitability by attackers POV

#### Types of Penetration Testing
1. Internal Pentesting
2. External Pentesting

- Penetration Testing
1. Black Box
2. White Box
3. Grey Box


 ##### **Black Box**  
 
**Blind Testing**
In a blind test, a tester is only given the name of the enterprise that's being targeted.
This gives security personnel a real-time look into how an actual attack would take place. time consuming and expensive process.

**Double Blind Testing**
This kind of testing is similar to blind testing, apart from that there is someone in the organization who is aware of the activity going on. The test is done to determine how fast and effective the security team is keen on monitoring or response and prepares the firm for a potential real attack and in sealing loopholes.

##### White Box

Full info available 
- It helps revealing bugs and vulnerabilities more quickly
- It provides assurance on complete testing as the tester knows what's exactly to be tested

**Announced Testing**
- Done With full cooperation and knowledge of IT Staff and Involves them in it.
- Examines Existing Security Infrastructure for Possible Vulnerabilities

**Unannounced Testing**
- Done without the knowledge of IT staff of the target
- Only upper management will know the company
- Checks the responsiveness of IT staff


##### Grey Box
- This test is the combination of black-box and white-box penetration testing With limited knowledge
- Done Internally
- Usually starts as black box and will be transformed into a grey one depends on needs.


#### Penetration Testing Process
1. Defining the scope
2. Performing the Penetration test
3. Reporting and Delivering Results

##### ROI for Penetration Testing

- It Helps companies in identifying, understanding, and addressing any attackers, which saves them a lot of money resulting in ROl
- companies will spend resources on pen-testing only if they have proper knowledge of its benefits
- Demonstration of ROl is a critical process for the successful selling of the pen test.

- Investing to avoid a loss or a higher future expense
- Differentiation with a secure solution
- Documents to win new clients



When Pentest Needed
-  There are changes made in the organization's infrastructure 
- A new threat is discovered to the organization's infrastructure
- There is update or reinstalled hardware or software
- There is a change in the organization's policy
