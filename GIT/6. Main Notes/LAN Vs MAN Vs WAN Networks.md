# LAN Vs MAN Vs WAN Networks
  
**Local Area Network (LAN)**

A Local Area Network (LAN) is a small network that is smaller than a Penn, but bigger than a local area. It is a network that expands across multiple floors, offices, buildings, and even localities.

- **Key Features:**
    

- Used in offices, homes, schools, and libraries
    
- Nodes are placed on different levels or sections
    
- Typical range:100-2000 meters
    

- **Definition:** LAN is a local area network that connects multiple devices within a limited geographical area.
    

**Man or Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

A Man or Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is bigger than a LAN and expands across multiple cities and towns. It is like a LAN, but on a larger scale.

- **Key Features:**
    

- Expands across multiple cities and towns
    
- Connections are made between buildings and localities
    
- Typical range:5-50 kilometers
    

- **Definition:** MAN is a metropolitan area network that connects multiple devices within a larger geographical area.
    

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**

A Wide Area Network (WAN) is the biggest possible network and expands across the whole world. It is not tied to specific locations and allows localized networks to communicate with each other across great distances.

- **Key Features:**
    

- Expands across continents and countries
    
- Connections are made between networks and devices worldwide
    
- Typical range:100,000 kilometers or more
    

- **Definition:** WAN is a wide area network that connects multiple devices and networks across a vast geographical area.
    

**Relationship between LAN, MAN, and WAN**

- LAN is the smallest network and is contained within a local area
    
- MAN is bigger than LAN and expands across multiple cities and towns
    
- WAN is the largest network and expands across the whole world
    

**Comparison Table:**

**Key Takeaways:**

- LAN is the smallest network and is contained within a local area
    
- MAN is bigger than LAN and expands across multiple cities and towns
    
- WAN is the largest network and expands across the whole world
    
- Each network type has its own unique characteristics and features
    
- Understanding the differences between LAN, MAN, and WAN is crucial for designing and implementing effective network systems.
