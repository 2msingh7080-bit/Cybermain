# Network Topologies

- **Topology**:
    - Defines how nodes are connected within a network.
    - Reflects the physical or logical arrangement of devices.
    - Chosen based on network size, environment, and purpose.

**Nodes in a Network**:

- Devices in a network that are connected to communicate and share resources.
- The arrangement of these connections determines the network's **topology**.
#### **Types of Network Topologies**

1. **Bus Topology**:
    - **Description**: Nodes are connected sequentially along a single backbone cable.
    - **Features**:
        - Data flows in both directions along the cable.
        - Simple and cost-effective.
    - **Drawbacks**:
        - Limited scalability.
        - A failure in the main cable disrupts the entire network.
2. **Star Topology**:
    - **Description**: All nodes are connected to a central hub or switch.
    - **Features**:
        - Centralized management.
        - Easy to add or remove devices.
    - **Drawbacks**:
        - Failure of the central hub affects the entire network.
3. **Mesh Topology**:
    - **Description**: Each node is interconnected with multiple nodes.
    - **Features**:
        - High fault tolerance.
        - Redundant paths for data transmission.
    - **Drawbacks**:
        - Expensive and complex to set up.
        - Requires significant cabling.
4. **Hybrid Topology**:
    - **Description**: Combines two or more types of topologies (e.g., star and bus).
    - **Features**:
        - Flexible and scalable.
        - Can be tailored to specific requirements.
    - **Drawbacks**:
        - Complexity in design and maintenance.
