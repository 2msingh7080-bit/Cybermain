- - Nodes are points or devices in a network where communication either starts or stops.
    - Example: In a conversation, both parties serve as nodes.
- **Types of Nodes**:
    - **Transmitting Node**: The device sending the information.
    - **Receiving Node**: The device receiving the information.
## <span style="color:rgb(20, 196, 255)">Role of Nodes in Data Communication</span>

- Nodes facilitate the flow of data within a network.
- **Flow of Information**: Data can either start or stop at these nodes.
- **Analogy**:
    - Just as people share information in a group, nodes allow devices to share data and resources.
## <span style="color:rgb(157, 116, 251)">Hosts vs. Stations</span>

- Different types of networks assign different names to nodes based on their connection type.
    
    - **<span style="color:rgb(20, 196, 255)">Hosts</span>**:
        - Refers to nodes in a **wired network**.
        - Example: Computers connected via Ethernet cables.
    - **<span style="color:rgb(20, 196, 255)">Stations</span>**:
        - Refers to nodes in a **wireless network**.
        - Example: Laptops or mobile devices connected via Wi-Fi.
- **Important Note**: 
        - **Wired Network** = Hosts
        - **Wireless Network** = Stations
## <span style="color:rgb(157, 116, 251)">Summary of Key Points</span>

- **What are Nodes**: Essential endpoints in a network facilitating communication.
- **Roles**: Transmitting and receiving data, forming the backbone of networked communication.
- **Terminology**: Understanding the difference between hosts and stations is crucial for identifying node types based on network configuration.
- **Scalability**: Networks can range from a few nodes to thousands, emphasizing the importance of nodes in data transfer.
