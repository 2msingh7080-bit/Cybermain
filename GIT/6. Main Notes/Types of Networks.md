# Types of Networks
#### **Hierarchical Order of Networks**

- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**:
    
    - **Smallest network**.
    - Typically covers a **small area** like a room or an individualâ€™s workspace.
    - Used for **personal devices** such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets.
    - Example: Connecting a Bluetooth headset to a smartphone.
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**:
    
    - **Larger than PAN**, covers a **single building or campus**.
    - **Used for office or home networks**, allowing devices to connect to shared resources such as printers and files.
    - Typically involves a **central device** (e.g., a router or switch) that facilitates communication between devices.
    - Example: A home Wi-Fi network.
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**:
    
    - **Bigger than LAN**, covers a **larger geographical area**, like a city or a group of buildings in a metropolitan area.
    - **Connects multiple LANs** within a city.
    - Often used by **municipalities or large organizations**.
    - Example: A university campus network connecting several buildings across a city.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**:
    
    - **The largest network** that connects multiple **LANs or MANs** across broad geographical areas, such as across cities, countries, or even continents.
    - Typically involves **public or private communication infrastructures** like the **Internet** or leased lines.
    - Example: The Internet, which connects users worldwide.

#### **Connecting Media for Networks**

- Networks are formed by connecting devices (like computers, printers, routers) using various types of connecting media. These include:
    - **Wired media**:
        - Copper cables (Ethernet cables, coaxial cables).
        - Fiber optic cables (for high-speed, long-distance connections).
    - **Wireless media**:
        - Wi-Fi (for local wireless connectivity).
        - Cellular networks (for mobile data and communication).
        - Bluetooth (for short-range, low-power connections).

#### **Summary**

- **PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN**: Networks are categorized based on their **size** and **coverage area**.
    - **PAN** is the smallest, typically for personal use.
    - **LAN** connects devices within a single building or campus.
    - **MAN** connects multiple LANs in a city or metropolitan area.
    - **WAN** is the largest network, connecting devices across long distances, including the Internet.
