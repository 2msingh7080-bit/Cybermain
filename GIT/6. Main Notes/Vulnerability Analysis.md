# Vulnerability Analysis

### Vulnerability Classification
- Misconfiguration
- Default Installations
- Buffer-overflow
- Unpatched Servers 
- Design Flaws 
- Operating System Flaws 
- Application Flaws
- Open Services 
- Default Passwords 

### **Steps for Vulnerability Analysis**
1. Vulnerability Research
2.  Categorizing (under level of criticality)
3.  Vulnerability Scanning
4. Vulnerability Assessment
### **Vulnerability Research** 
Process of discovering Vulnerabilities  and design flaws  that will open an operating system and its applications to attacks or misuse.

**An administrator needs Vulnerability research** 
- To gather information about security trends, threats and attacks. 
- To find weaknesses and alert the network administrator before a network attack.
- To get information that help to prevent security problems. 
- To know how to recover from a network attacks.

To check Vulnerabilities using database  website 
-  CVE 
steps for Vulnerability assessment (research )
1. identifying Vulnerability  
2. checking for criticality of Vulnerability and listing it under criticality 
3. Identifying Vulnerability  dependence.

Checking Vulnerability in meta2 
	
	checking -sV (version service )  
	
	found vsftpd 2 - https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-2523

#### To display CEV's using namp

1. script for Vulnerability 
	- locate *.nse | grep vulners 
	- /usr/share/legion/scripts/nmap/vulners.nse
	- sudo nmap --script vulners 10.0.0.171 - SV
2. nmap vulscan github
	 download it in file path under namp 
		 cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts 
	sudo git clone https://github.com/scipag/vulscan.git
3. To run script
	 
	 sudo nmap --script vulscan/vulsacn.nse 10.10.10.6 -sV

Checking Vulnerability expoit code and EDB  
using 
1. exploit-db [link](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
2. packetstorm [link](https://packetstorm.news/) 
### **Vulnerability Scanning** 

- Vulnerability Scanning is an inspection oh=f the potential points of exploit  on a computer or network to identify security holes. 
- The software compares details about the target attack surface to a database of information about known security holes. 

**Vulnerability Scanners classify Vulnerabilities by**
- Security Level (low, medium, high )
- Exploit range (local, Remote )
**Vulnerability Assessment** 

- Vulnerability Assessment is an examination of the ability of a system or application , including current security procedures and controls, to withstand assault.
- IT **recognizes**, **measures**, and **classifies** security Vulnerabilities in a computer system, network, and communication.   

**Zero-Day (0-Day) Exploits**
- A zero-day exploit targets a previously unknown vulnerability that has not yet been patched or disclosed publicly. The term "zero-day" refers to the fact that developers have had zero days to address and patch the vulnerability.

- The **CVE ( Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures )** acts as reference for publicly known information security Vulnerabilities.
- Primary source for this information is **NVD (National Vulnerabilities  Database)**.
- NVD is maintained by **NIST (national Institute if Standards and technology )**  and managed by a branch of MITRE (Missile Test and Readiness Equipment).
-  NVD also contains a list of Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) used for communicating the characteristics of the risks and their impact on IT.

To check the critical of Vulnerabilities using 
 - cvedetails [link](https://www.cvedetails.com/)

To search CVE in cvedetails
- Example search for CVE-2011-2523
drupal 7 vulnerabilities

(CWE- core weakness  of product , CVE-  product )

###  ***List of network Vulnerability Scanners:***
-  OpenVAS 
- Nessus
-  Qualys 
- IBM Qradar Vulnerability Manger,
-  Sanit Nexpose,
-  Core impact.

 ### **List of Vulnerability research websites:**
- securityfocus.com
- vulnerability-lab.com
- us-cert.gov
- cvedetails.com

#### Setup of Nessus (trial)

1.  Downloading   Essentials
	- using mailinator.com 
	- keep key -AD4A-6W2G-6C82-HFP5-GYFB
2. Installing dkpg package and using 
	- sudo dkpg -i 
	- sudo service nessud start  
3. Creating username and password 
	- username- core5
	- passwored -Shift@09
4. To run nessus 
	- sudo service nessud start 
	- loaclhost or https://kali:8834 or  https://10.10.10.4:8834 or https://loaclhost:8834
	
- Nessus provide  only free 16 ip scanning 
- so after 16 scans again uses mailinator.com for creating new account and then use it 
- Nessus scanning 
	- creating policy or predefine 
	- add IP's to scan 
#### Alert Decision Table

| **Result**              | **Alert (Tool Detection)** | **Actual Vulnerability** | **Explanation**                                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **True Positive (TP)**  | Yes                        | Yes                      | The tool correctly detects a real vulnerability. ✅                            |
| **True Negative (TN)**  | No                         | No                       | The tool correctly identifies no vulnerability. ✅                             |
| **False Positive (FP)** | Yes                        | No                       | The tool falsely reports a vulnerability that doesn’t exist. ⚠️ (False Alarm) |
| **False Negative (FN)** | No                         | Yes                      | The tool fails to detect an actual vulnerability. ❌ (Risky)                   |
True Positive: When the test says you have it and you actually have it.
True negative: When the test says you don't have it and you actual don't have it.
False positive: When the test says you have it but you actually don't have it.
False negative: When the test says you don't have it but you actually have it.
