# Wireless Networks


#### **Overview of Wireless Networks**

- **Wireless Networks**: These networks do not require physical media (like cables) to transmit data. Instead, they use **wireless signals** that travel through the air or environment, which is essentially free of cost.
- **Types of Wireless Signals**:
    - **Radio Signals**: These signals are commonly used for wireless communication.
    - **Infrared Signals**: Another type of wireless signal, used in applications like TV remotes.

#### **Examples and Applications**

- **TV Remote Example**: The signals in your **TV remote** are infrared signals, which create a **wireless network** between the remote and the TV, allowing control without wires.

#### **Wireless Networks vs. Wired Networks**

- **Wireless LAN (Local Area Network)**: Similar to a wired LAN but uses wireless signals to connect devices.
- **Wireless WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Similar to wired WAN but connects devices over a broader range wirelessly.
- **Other Wireless Networks**:
    - **Wireless MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A network that covers a larger geographical area than LAN.
    - **Wireless PAN (Personal Area Network)**: A short-range network typically used for personal devices.

#### **Summary**

- **Wireless Networks** eliminate the need for physical cables, using radio and infrared signals instead. These networks can be applied in various types, such as LAN, WAN, and MAN, offering flexibility and mobility compared to wired networks.
