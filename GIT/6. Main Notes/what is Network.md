- A network is defined as an **interconnection between two or more nodes** that share data.
- Nodes can be any devices or machines capable of communicating with each other.

1. **<span style="color:rgb(20, 196, 255)">Nodes:</span>**
    
    - Machines or devices that connect to transfer data.
    - Examples include computers, servers, and mobile devices.
2. **<span style="color:rgb(20, 196, 255)">Channels of Communication:</span>**

    - Networks require a channel or medium for devices to communicate.
    - Different types of channels based on communication requirements:
        - **Wired Networks:**
            - Nodes are connected using cables (e.g., Ethernet).
             - **Wireless Networks:**
            - Nodes connect without physical cables, using technologies like Wi-Fi.

### <span style="color:rgb(157, 116, 251)">Summary</span> 

- A network is an interconnection of nodes that allows for data sharing and communication.
- The importance of communication channels (wired and wireless) cannot be understated in networking.
- Using analogies, such as human networks, helps simplify and clarify complex networking concepts.
- The visual representation of a computer network aids in understanding the structure and function of interconnected devices.
