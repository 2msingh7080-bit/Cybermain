# Denial-of-Service
### What is a DoS Attack?
-  Denial-of-Service (DoS) is an attack on a computer or network that reduces, restricts, or prevents accessibility of system resources to its legitimate users
- In a DoS attack, attackers flood the victim system with non-legitimate service requests or traffic to overload its resources
- The impact of DoS attacks include loss of goodwill, network outages, financial losses, and operational disruptions
### What is a DDoS Attack? 
Distributed Denial of Service attack
A DDoS attack is a large-scale, coordinated attack on the availability of services on a victim’s
system or network resources, and it is launched indirectly through many compromised computers (botnets) on the Internet.
### Botnets
 term “bot” is a contraction of “robot” and refers to software applications that run automated tasks over the Internet. Attackers use bots to infect a large number of computers that form a network, or “botnet,” allowing them to launch DDoS attacks, generate spam, spread viruses, and commit other types of crime.
