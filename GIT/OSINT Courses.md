## **Phishing: An Online Scam**

### Definition:

- A form of online fraud where criminals trick users into revealing sensitive data.
    
- Named after "fishing" as attackers try to "hook" users.
    

### Purpose:

- Obtain login credentials, banking details, and personal information.
    

### **Example of Phishing:**

- Fake emails posing as Google notifications.
    
- Often emphasize urgency.
    
- Contain misspellings and extra characters (e.g., "suppport" instead of "support").
    
- URLs do not match legitimate domains.
    
- May lack HTTPS security protocol.
    

### **Consequences of Clicking Phishing Links:**

- Attackers gain access to emails and stored passwords.
    
- Potential financial loss or identity theft.
    

### **How to Avoid Phishing Attacks:**

1. **Email Safety:**
    
    - Avoid using corporate email for social media or third-party registrations.
        
    - Do not open emails from unknown senders.
        
    - Check for misspellings, odd sender addresses, and unusual subject lines.
        
2. **File Attachments:**
    
    - Do not open office files (e.g., Word, Excel) from unknown sources.
        
    - Files may contain viruses or tracking programs (canary tokens) that expose your IP address.
        
3. **Avoid Provocative Messages:**
    
    - Scammers send urgent emails claiming account suspension or security issues.
        
    - Messages often have generic greetings like "Dear Account Owner."
        
    - Legitimate companies use personalized greetings.
        
4. **Checking URLs:**
    
    - Hover over links to verify authenticity.
        
    - Attackers create clone sites to steal credentials.
        
    - Use HTTPS sites with verified security certificates.
        
    - Look for URL encoding tricks (e.g., "%6D" instead of "M").
        
5. **Verifying Links:**
    
    - Use tools like checkshorturl.com and Norton Safe Web to analyze links.

## **Secure Messaging**

- Use messengers that support **peer-to-peer encryption** (messages stored only on devices, not cloud servers).
    
- Recommended secure messengers:
    
    - **Signal, Dust, Wire, and Threema (paid)**

## **VPN Usage: Protecting Online Privacy**

### **Why Use a VPN?**

- Hides user location and encrypts internet traffic.
    
- Essential for online investigations and data protection.
    

### **Dangers of Free VPNs:**

- Often funded by selling user data.
    
- Some contain ads and offer limited security.
    

### **Best Practices for VPNs:**

- Use trusted, paid VPNs (e.g., **NordVPN, Windscribe**).
    
- Avoid using multiple VPNs simultaneously.
    
- Verify the VPN provider’s privacy policies.

## **Summary & Key Takeaways**

- **Phishing is a major cybersecurity threat** – verify emails, avoid unknown links, and use email security best practices.
    
- **Use encrypted messengers** for sensitive communications.
    
- **Free VPNs may compromise privacy** – opt for reputable paid services.
