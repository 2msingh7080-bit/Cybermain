### Compliances  

#### HIPAA
HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is United States legislation that provides ==data privacy== and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. The law has emerged into greater prominence in recent years with the proliferation of health ==data breaches== caused by cyberattacks and ==ransomware== attacks on health insurers and providers.


#### SOX ( Accounting firms)
- The U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on July 30 of that year to help protect investors from fraudulent financial reporting by corporations. Also known as the SOX Act of 2002 and the Corporate Responsibility Act of 2002.
- The act created strict new rules for accountants, auditors, and corporate officers and imposed more strict recordkeeping requirements.
- it mandated strict reforms to existing securities regulations and imposed tough new penalties on lawbreakers.


#### FISMA (US - General)
- The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) is United States legislation that defines a comprehensive framework to protect government information, operations and assets against natural or man-made threats.
- FISMA assigns responsibilities to various agencies to ensure the security of data in the federal government. The act requires program officials, and the head of each agency, to conduct annual reviews of information security programs, with the intent of keeping risks at or below specified acceptable levels in a cost- effective, timely and efficient manner.

#### GLBA (Banks)
- GLBA was created to allow these financial industry participants to offer more services.
- The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also required financial institutions offering consumers loan services, financial or investment advice, and/or insurance, to fully explain their information sharing practices to their customers. Firms must allow their customers the option to "opt-out" if they do not want their sensitive information shared. While many consider critical information, such as bank balances and account numbers, to be confidential, in reality this data is consistently bought and sold by banks, credit card companies, and others.

##### GLBA (CONT.)
 - GLBA compliance is mandatory; whether a financial institution discloses nonpublic information or not, there must be a policy in place to protect the information from foreseeable threats in security and data integrity.
- It Has 3 Important Parts:
	1. Financial Privacy Rule (Letting Consumers Know what data is collected and how it is used)
	2. Safeguards Rule (How it continues to protect the information)
	3. Pretexting Protection (Social Engineering Protection.)

#### Frame Work 
##### COBIT
COBIT stands for Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology. It is a framework created by the ISACA (==Information Systems Audit and Control== ==Association==) for IT governance and management. It was designed to be a supportive tool for managers-and allows bridging the crucial gap between technical issues, business risks, and control requirements. COBIT is a thoroughly recognized guideline that can be applied to any organization in any industry. Overall, COBIT ensures quality, control, and reliability of information systems in organization, which is also the most important aspect of every modern business.
