### Weaknesses of your CV

1. **Lack of Quantifiable Results**:
    
    - Your projects and achievements don’t currently include measurable outcomes or metrics (e.g., “identified 10 vulnerabilities in a web application using Burp Suite” or “reduced network latency by analyzing packet anomalies”).
    - **Suggestion**: Add specific results where possible to show the impact of your work.
2. **Education Section is Sparse**:
    
    - It only mentions your degree and expected graduation date, with no mention of coursework, GPA, or academic achievements.
    - **Suggestion**: Include key coursework (e.g., Networking, Cybersecurity Principles) or academic accolades (if any).
3. **Certifications Section**:
    
    - While the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** is a strong inclusion, no date or progress indication is provided.
    - **Suggestion**: Add the completion date or state "In Progress" if you’re still working on it.
4. **Extra-Curricular Activities Section**:
    
    - While "Hit the Bug" is an excellent achievement, this section could benefit from more diversity or additional relevant activities.
    - **Suggestion**: Include other technical or leadership activities, if applicable, to show versatility.
5. **Interests/Hobbies Lack Relevance to Cybersecurity**:
    
    - While this section shows a well-rounded personality, there is little direct relevance to cybersecurity.
    - **Suggestion**: Reframe or expand some hobbies to highlight transferable skills (e.g., gaming for strategic thinking or volunteering for teamwork).
6. **Absence of Soft Skills**:
    
    - The CV focuses heavily on technical skills but lacks mention of soft skills like teamwork, communication, or adaptability.
    - **Suggestion**: Briefly mention these in your objective or achievements to convey a balanced skill set.
7. **No Work Experience**:
    
    - The CV does not include internships, part-time jobs, or volunteer work related to cybersecurity.
    - **Suggestion**: If you have relevant experience, even if unpaid, include it in a "Work Experience" or "Relevant Experience" section.
8. **Formatting Could Be Enhanced**:
    
    - Some sections could be more visually distinct for better readability.
    - **Suggestion**: Add slight spacing adjustments or use subtle lines to separate sections.

### Actionable Steps:

- Incorporate measurable achievements in the **Projects** section.
- Expand the **Education** section with coursework or academic highlights.
- Add dates or progress to certifications.
- Diversify the **Extra-Curricular Activities** section with technical or leadership roles.
- Reframe hobbies to connect to cybersecurity or transferable skills.
- Consider adding a "Soft Skills" section or emphasizing these in your profile/objective.

### Soft Skills

1. **Problem-Solving**
    
    - Essential for debugging, vulnerability assessment, and troubleshooting cybersecurity challenges.
2. **Attention to Detail**
    
    - Critical for analyzing network packets, identifying anomalies, and working on security vulnerabilities.
3. **Critical Thinking**
    
    - Useful for assessing threats, evaluating potential solutions, and making informed decisions in cybersecurity.
4. **Communication Skills**
    
    - Important for explaining technical findings, collaborating with teams, and presenting reports to non-technical stakeholders.
5. **Adaptability**
    
    - Necessary for keeping pace with evolving cybersecurity threats and learning new tools/technologies.
6. **Teamwork**
    
    - Valuable for working effectively with colleagues on projects, simulations, or incident response teams.
7. **Time Management**
    
    - Crucial for managing multiple tasks like scanning networks, analyzing packets, and meeting project deadlines.
8. **Research Skills**
    
    - Useful for staying updated on the latest cybersecurity trends, tools, and techniques.
9. **Leadership Potential**
    
    - Demonstrated through your ability to take initiative, such as participating in competitions and leading tasks in group settings.
