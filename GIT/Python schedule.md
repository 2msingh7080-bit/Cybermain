- **Black Hat Python** (for cybersecurity context)

### Key Success Factors:

1. **Code daily** - Consistency beats intensity
2. **Break problems down** - Start with simple versions, then add complexity
3. **Read other people's code** - Especially security-focused projects on GitHub
4. **Practice debugging** - Learn to read error messages effectively
5. **Document your code** - Write comments explaining your thinking

### Libraries to Familiarize Yourself With:

- **Built-in:** `os`, `sys`, `socket`, `hashlib`, `json`, `csv`, `re`, `datetime`
- **Third-party:** `requests`, `scapy`, `paramiko`, `python-nmap`
