xbow AI 


Hi Kishore Sir,

You’re absolutely right, I recently came across Xbow AI, where AI actually works like a penetration tester and it really hit me: we can’t survive without AI anymore. Instead, we need to integrate it into our workflow.

Recently, I completed CEH v13, where we even used SGPT for automation. It showed me how powerful AI can be in cybersecurity domain.

I wanted to ask  what are some practical ways to skill up in this AI-driven security space?

Right now, I’m using:
- ChatGPT – general assistance
- Claude AI – scripting & code-based tasks
- Notebook LLM – notes, flashcards, and podcasts
- Perplexity – research and search

I know it’s still important to master the core subjects and, gain hands-on experience alongside AI, but I’d love to hear your thoughts on the best ways to combine both for faster growth.
