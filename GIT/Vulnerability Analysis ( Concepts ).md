# Vulnerability Analysis ( Concepts )
### Vulnerability Classification
- [ ] if to do 

### Vulnerability Scoring Systems and Databases 
 - Vulnerability databases collect and maintain information about various vulnerabilities present in information systems. Following are some of the vulnerability scoring systems and databases: 
	 - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 
	 - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 
	 - National Vulnerability Database (NVD) 
	 - Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)







#### Vulnerability-Management Life Cycle

#### Vulnerability Research
- Resources for Vulnerability Research
- The following are some of the websites used to perform vulnerability research. 
	- Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)
	-  Packet Storm (https://packetstormsecurity.com) 
	- Dark Reading (https://www.darkreading.com) 
	- Trend Micro (https://www.trendmicro.com)

#### Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis 
There are two approaches to network vulnerability scanning:
1. Active scanning:
2.  Passive scanning:
#### Types of Vulnerability Scanning
- Types of Vulnerability Scanning are 
	- Network-Based
	- Host-Based
	- Application
	- Database
	- Cloud
	- Authenticated
	- Unauthenticated
	- Active
	- Passive

#### AI-Powered Vulnerability Assessment Tools
- such as  
	- Equixly 
	-  SmartScanner
	- CodeDefender 
	- Corgea 
	- Fluxguard 
	- DryRun Security
	- Pentest Copilot

### Vulnerability Assessment using AI 
- Example #1: “Launch nikto to execute a scan against the URL www.certifiedhacker.com to identify potential vulnerabilities.”
	- command 
		-  `` nikto -h www.certifiedhacker.com ``
- Example #2: “Perform vulnerability scan on target url http://testphp.vulnweb.com with nikto and save the results in output.txt.” 
	- command 
		- ``nikto -h http://testphp.vulnweb.com -o output.txt``

#### Vulnerability Scan using Nmap with AI 
- “Perform a vulnerability scan on target url www.moviescope.com with nmap and save the results in output.txt”
	- command 
	- `` nmap -sV –script=vuln www.moviescope.com -oN output.txt ``
#### Vulnerability Assessment using Python Script with AI
- “Create a python script to run a fast but comprehensive Nmap scan on the IP addresses in scan1.txt and then execute vulnerability scanning using nikto against each IP address in scan1.txt”
#### Vulnerability Scan using Skipfish with AI 
-  “Perform a vulnerability scan on target url http://testphp.vulnweb.com with Skipfish and display the output file index.html in Firefox.”
	- command  
		- `` skipfish -o /tmp/skipfish_output http://testphp.vulnweb.com && firefox tmp/skipfish_output/index.html``

## Task 1: Perform Vulnerability Analysis using OpenVAS
steps for running 
- command terminal as sudo su 
	- `` docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas mikesplain/openvas**``
- go to **https://127.0.0.1/**. OpenVAS login page appears, 
	- log in with **admin**/**admin**.


#### using nikto
- ``nikto -h <domain>``
