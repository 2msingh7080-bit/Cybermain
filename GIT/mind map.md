# Footprinting Mind Map (CEH v13)

This document presents a detailed breakdown of footprinting techniques, as visualized in a mind map format, based on the CEH v13 curriculum. Footprinting, the initial phase of ethical hacking, involves gathering information about a target organization to understand its security posture and potential vulnerabilities. This document outlines the various aspects of footprinting, including information gathering methods, tools, and countermeasures, providing a comprehensive overview for cybersecurity professionals and aspiring ethical hackers.

## I. Footprinting Concepts

- **Definition:** Gathering information about a target system or network.
    
- **Objectives:**
    
    - Learn security posture.
        
    - Identify potential vulnerabilities.
        
    - Reduce focus area.
        
    - Draw network map.
        
- **Types:**
